This project was a semester long project for Applied Programming Concepts where myself and 7 others were tasked with creating a full casino with playable games and a functional database with players, balances, etc. The parts of the project that I contributed to were all of the Poker files as this was my assigned game. I was in charge of coding poker and implementing it with the database. I created a version of poker where a user is drawn 5 cards and then has the ability to bet based on the hand they were given. If the hand they had ranked higher than the other users hands that player one. We used SQLite to implement the database within our C++ code. All of the poker files along with some parts of the system functions files were my contributions.
